STM32F407G-DISC1_MorseCodeDecoder
This project is a continuation of STM32F407G-DISC1_Tutorials.

This repository contains a Morse code decoder project for the STM32F407G-DISC1 development board. It serves as a great first project to further develop your understanding of STM32 programming, especially if you've already worked through the tutorials in STM32F407G-DISC1_Tutorials.

Project Overview
The Morse code decoder project is designed to decode Morse code signals into text using the STM32F407G-DISC1 board. This project leverages many of the fundamental concepts covered in the STM32F407G-DISC1 tutorials, such as:

GPIO pin configuration
Timer management
Interrupt handling
Communication protocols
What's Inside
The repository includes:

A folder with the full project for your chosen IDE (such as Keil, STM32CubeIDE, or others).
Source code and documentation to help you understand the Morse code decoding process.
Why This Project?
This project is a perfect next step after completing the STM32F407G-DISC1 tutorials. It applies many of the foundational skills you've learned, helping you further solidify your knowledge of STM32 microcontroller programming. By building this Morse code decoder, you'll gain practical experience in signal decoding and embedded systems development.
